# open-sourced-submissions
Submissions made by those who have agreed to have their contributions open-sourced.

Each folder represents a set of files as submitted to Codalab.

Submissions that were part of Cos 424 at Princeton include PDF write-ups that were prepared for the class, and which are not expected of all participants..
