# open-sourced-submissions
Submissions made by those who have agreed to have their contributions open-sourced.

Each folder represents a set of files as submitted to Codalab. The naming convention is determined by Codalab, and is "[username] - [submission number] submission".

Submissions that were part of COS 424 at Princeton include PDF write-ups that were prepared for the class, and which are not expected of all participants.
