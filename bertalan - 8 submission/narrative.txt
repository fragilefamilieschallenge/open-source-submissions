A large longitudinal dataset of feature values describing about four thousand
children from mostly unmarried parents is treated as a black-box regression,
in which a small set of response variables from the most recent wave of the
survey is estimated using a subset of the more than twelve thousand predictor
variables estimated over the course the participants' childhoods.

Data is pre-processed by dropping columns with an excessive count of missing
values, imputing remaining missing values with per-column modes, and converting
categorical variables to a one-hot encoding.

Methods used include radial basis function support vector machine regression,
as well as ridge, LASSO, and elastic net regression, with best results being
obtained from the last of these. Directions for future work are discussed,
including performing linear and nonlinear dimension-reduction on the predictor
features, as well as using matrix- and manifold-completion methods in place of
simple modal imputation.
