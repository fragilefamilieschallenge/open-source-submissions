The following models were used:
GPA,Grit,Eviction,jobTraining fit by MultiClassElasticnetCVRFitter()
materialHardship fit by ElasticNetRegressionFitter()
Layoff fit by average-ensembling of separately fit ElasticNetRegressionFitter() and MultiClassElasticnetCVRFitter(), with previous CV settings for ElasticnetRegressionFitter. I think it's a fluke this model did (only very slightly) better than the MultiClassElasticnetCVRFitter() output. That is probably the better model to use.
