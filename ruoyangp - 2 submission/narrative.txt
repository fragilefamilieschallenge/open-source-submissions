In this effprt, we are working with a large survey dataset (from the Fragile Framilies and Child Wellbeing Study) with many features and are attempting to predict 6 outcomes. The survey data follows nearly 5000 children born in major US cities and asks questions from birth to age 9 to help predict 6 key outcomes by age 15. The goal of the assignment is to work through multiple methods to arrive at a best prediction of the 6 key outcomes by age 15 using the survey data provided. In this assignment, we explored imputation and data cleansing, feature selection and dimensionality reduction, and employed multiple classifiers to arrive at a best-effort prediction for the outcomes. This effort focuses on predicting the 3 binary outcomes and was created by Vincent Peng (ruoyangp@princeton.edu) and Alex Rivas (amrivas@princeton.edu).
